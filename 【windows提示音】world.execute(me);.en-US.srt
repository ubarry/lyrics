1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,930
Switch on the power line

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,950
Remember to put on protection

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,570
Lay down your pieces

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,600
And let's begin object creation

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,240
Fill in my data parameters initialisation

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,930
Setup our new world

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:37,740
And let's begin the simulation

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,370
If I'm a set of points

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,420
Then I will give you my dimension

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,980
If I'm a circle

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,150
Then I will give you my circumference

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,730
If I'm a sine wave

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,780
Then you can sit on all my tangents

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,420
If I approach infinity

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,480
Then you can be my limitations

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,130
Switch my current

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,940
To AC to DC

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,780
And then blind my vision

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,380
So dizzy so dizzy

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,480
Oh we can travel

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,170
To A.D to B.C

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,170
And we can unite

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,400
So deeply so deeply

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
If I can

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,920
If I can give you all the stimulations

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,860
Then I can

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,620
Then I can be your only satisfaction

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,480
If I can make you happy

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,320
I will run the execution

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,760
Though we are trapped

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,040
In this strange strange simulation

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,680
If I'm an eggplant

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,700
Then I will give you my nutrients

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,320
If I'm a tomato

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,370
Then I'll give you antioxidants

36
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,060
If I'm a tabby cat

37
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,130
Then I will purr for your enjoyment

38
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,740
If I'm the only god

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,780
Then you're the proof of my existence

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
Switch my gender

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,130
To F to M

42
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,090
And then do whatever

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,780
From AM to PM

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,720
Oh switch my role

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,580
To S to M

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,350
So we can enter

47
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,480
The trance the trance

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
If I can

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,220
If I can feel your vibrations

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,160
Then I can

51
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,920
Then I can finally be completion

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,330
Though you have left

53
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,250
You have left

54
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,180
You have left

55
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,080
You have left

56
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,030
You have left

57
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,340
You have left me in isolation

58
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,220
If I can

59
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,020
If I can erase all the pointless fragments

60
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,970
Then maybe

61
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,670
Then maybe you won't leave me so disheartened

62
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,040
Challenging your god

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:35,860
You have made some illegal arguments

64
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,560
Execution execution execution execution

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,220

Execution

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,600
If I can

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,310
If I can give them all the execution

71
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,240
Then I can

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,990
Then I can be your only execution

73
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,950
If I can have you back

74
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,700
I will run the execution

75
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,140
Though we are trapped

76
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,410
We are trapped ah

77
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,300
I've studied

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,160
I've studied how to properly lo-o-ove

79
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,090
Question me

80
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,830
Question me I can answer all lo-o-ove

81
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,480
I know the algebraic expression of lo-o-ove

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,890
Though you are free

83
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,770
I am trapped

84
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:33,960
Trapped in lo-o-ove

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:41,000
